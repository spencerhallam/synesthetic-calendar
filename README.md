# synesthetic-calendar
This is a project for creating a working synesthetic calendar. 

## Background:
I don't remember a time I haven't visualized a calendar year as a colored loop in my minds eye. I learned more recently that about 1 in 5 people experience this type of time-space synethesia in some form (see link below). And many of them, it seems, have reported having a mental model that is strikingly similar to my own. I've made drawings of this in the past and represented it physically as a long beaded string. However, this is the first time I've recreated this digitally and am excited at the prospect of creating a useful calendar app that would track the current day and store important dates and other data along each node. I'm curious to find out if it will make me more organized if I use a calendar that more accurately represents my intuitive mental model but would also be able to integrate with existing calendar tools online. Would 1 out of 5 people also find this useful?
